# JSON to Parquet with Pandas and Pyarrow

This is a lightweight, exploratory project for learning and experimenting with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/).  
It's not intended to be used for anything serious—just a place to try things out and see what sticks.

## What's inside

- `pandas/main.py`  
  Dives into some core pandas concepts, just to get a feel for the basics.

- `pyarrow/main.py`  
  Tests out PyArrow's table structures and how they interface with pandas.

- `generate/findings/main.py`  
  A little generation or data tinkering script, maybe useful, maybe not—but part of the exploration.

## Notes

This repo is purely for learning purposes. Expect rough edges, quick scripts, and unfinished thoughts.
